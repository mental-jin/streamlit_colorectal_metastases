This project loads scikit-learn/joblib artifacts from ml_results/*/artifacts.

To avoid Streamlit Cloud unpickling errors (e.g. missing internal sklearn classes like _RemainderColsList), keep these versions aligned with the environment that created the artifacts.

Local (artifact-producing) environment versions:
- scikit-learn==1.5.1
- joblib==1.4.2
- numpy==1.26.4
- scipy==1.13.1
- pandas==2.3.2
- openpyxl==3.1.5
- xgboost==3.1.2
